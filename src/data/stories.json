It's created when highly energetic charged particles from the Sun, carried by the solar wind, are channeled by Earth's magnetic field toward the polar regions. These particles then collide with atoms and molecules (like oxygen and nitrogen) in our upper atmosphere. The collisions excite the atoms, causing them to emit light of different colors, which we see as the aurora's dancing curtains and shimmering ribbons.The most common color, the brilliant green seen in this photo, is produced by collisions with oxygen atoms at specific altitudes."

The CME appears as a bright, cloud-like structure moving outward, showcasing the immense energy and mass ejected during such solar events. CMEs can have significant effects on space weather, especially if they are directed toward Earth."
